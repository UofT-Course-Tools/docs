# Course Guide

## Vision
The Course Guide component helps students have a better understanding of what the right courses for them are.

The Course Guide generates a list of recommend courses based on the student's year and programs from students.

## Overview

The user's journey through the course guide starts at them selecting their year and ends at them optimizing their timetable.

### Program Selection

After a user selects their year, they're able to browse through the list of programs available to them, adding programs to their program cart as they see fit.

### Course Selection

With the programs selected, the user now moves to the course selection stage. Here, the user can add courses to their course cart by exploring courses via the search bar or consulting our _Recommended Courses_ UI component's suggestions.
