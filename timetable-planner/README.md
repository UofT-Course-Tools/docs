# Timetable Planner

A web app that helps UofT students plan their courses to generate their optimal timetable. 

The timetable planner allows students to enter their course load and get back a timetable that fits their needs. The vision for the timetable planner includes taking student preferences into account such as: 

- How early students wish to start and end classes
- What days students would like to take off
- What times students would prefer gap time and breaks
