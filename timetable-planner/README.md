# Timetable Planner

A web app that helps UofT students plan their courses to generate their optimal timetable. 

The timetable planner allows students to enter their course load and get back a timetable that fits their needs. The vision for the timetable planner includes taking student preferences into account such as: 

- How early students wish to start and end classes
- What days students would like to take off
- What times students would prefer gap time and breaks


## Overview

![timetable-journey](./Timetable-journey.png)

Once the user selects the courses from the Course Guide:

![coursechosing](./coursechosing.png)

The user views the timetable:

The timetable will display whether or not if the selected courses have a valid time, that is no conflict for all courses.

 - Valid:
 
![timetable](./timetable.png)

 - Invalid:
 
![error1](./error1.png)

There are serveral preferences that the user can select to optimize the timetable:

![timetableconstraint](./timetableconstraint.png)


 - Minimize/Maximize idle time: The user can maximize or minimize the gap time between courses.
 - Days off: The user can select the day(s) off so there will be no course appear on that day.
 - Avoid Morning/Evening Class: The user can choose whether if they want to have courses in the morning or evening.
 
The timetable will return invalid and displays a message if the constraints are unreachable.

![error2](./error2.png)

The user can also choose to lock certain course times. 

When preferences are made, those times will not be changed.

after some preferences made:

## Example Usage:

### Future Implementation:

Given a set of course codes, the timetable planner outputs the schedule available for the set.

If no such schedule available, outputs "inValid".

//Setting up preference are still work in progress

#### Input:

```json
#provided two courses with two section for simplicity
{
    "CourseCode": {
        "CSC108H5F2019":{
            "L0101":[{

## Current Implementateion
### (WIP)

Given a set of times, check if there is a valid timetable avaliable.

Outputs "Valid" if such timetable exist, or else "inValid".

#### Input:

```json
#provided one set of time to check if a valid timetable exist
